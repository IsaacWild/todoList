# todoList

This is my todo list project for the Odin Project course that I modelled for a real-world restaurant.

## Description

This was made as a part of my Odin Project todo list I wanted to make a colourful and bright layout without being too overbearing or confusing with alerts built in to guide people on useage of the site.

Within the project I was tasked with using webpack, this is my 2nd project using it and I hope to expand my knowledge and use of the service in more of my projects going forward, I worked entirely to make the site through DOM manipulation to help practice my skills but in future tasks I may work to have the default page written into the HTML to give a landing page if there is a java script issue for a user then they are not left with a blank page.

I found it a challenging but intresting project that allowed me to strengthen my new skills with using webpack and I chose to only make this a desktop layout for now as I want to wait untill later projects to help implement more use freindly tools into a mobile design powered by further java script such as drop-downs and sliders that we are learining in the next modules.

I am proud of my first project to also use JSON with local storage to have a functional database saved locally to ensure projects and tasks are not lost between visits to the page. Returning to this in the future I would like to add more style control in relation to tasks and projects allowing user choice for theme's and a mobile friendly layout for smaller screened devices.
